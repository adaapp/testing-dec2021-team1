### Problem Statement 

We will be creating a colour code converter. The MVP is that it will allow you to convert RGB to Hex colours and vice versa.

### Coding Practice
We will be coding using React. Initially, we had to take some time away to research and develop our understanding. We chose to use React as not only is it flexible but fast and simple to use as a framework for handling the view of our web. It also allows for easy collaboration. 
<br>

As well, we will be creating issues on GitHub around tasks we need to complete or areas we need approval or help on. Some of our issues consisted of

### Testing 

Code
<br>
We will be running smoke tests as our preliminary testing to confirm that our build is stable enough for further testing. Smoke tests will easily identify small failures, for us to fix. During our testing phase, we will also be 'throwing an error'; to indicate whether anything unexpected will happen to disrupt the normal flow of execution. 

Design
<br>
We will be sending out a google form to our cohort to ensure the best design is chosen; the one thats simpler to navigate, easier to use and the most appropriate font and colour.

## GitHub Pages 

We have chosen to use GitHub pages, as it is a service that takes HTML, CSS nad JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub and runs the files through a build process and then to publish a website. It is easy for collaboration and clearly identifies where improvements have been made and by who.
