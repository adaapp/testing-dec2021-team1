## Welcome!

### Problem Statement 

We will be creating a colour code converter. The MVP is that it will allow you to convert RGB to Hex colours and vice versa.

Branch test example

### Coding Practice
We will be coding using React. Initially, we had to take some time away to research and develop our understanding. We chose to use React as not only is it flexible but fast and simple to use as a framework for handling the view of our web. It also allows for easy collaboration. 
<br>

As well, we will be creating issues on GitHub around tasks we need to complete or areas we need approval or help on. 

#### Continuous integration/continuous delivery



### Testing 

Code
<br>
We will be running smoke tests as our preliminary testing to confirm that our build is stable enough for further testing. Smoke tests will easily identify small failures, for us to fix. During our testing phase, we will also be 'throwing an error'; to indicate whether anything unexpected will happen to disrupt the normal flow of execution. 

Design
<br>
We will be sending out a google form to our cohort to ensure the best design is chosen; the one thats simpler to navigate, easier to use and the most appropriate font and colour.

### Testing Strategy 

Our first testing consisted of smoke testing, to determine whether the initial build is stable or not. We created a test to throw out an error when a user...

We decided to work on testing our individual functions before incooperating the HTML/CSS...

To ensure good coding practice throughout this project we regularly tested and went through our code reviews as a team on pull requests before they were merged into the main branch.

Our workflow meant that we worked well as a team; one worked on the issue relevant to their area and if they needed help, it was easy to collobrate and let the rest of the team know. Once the coding, designs or testing had been completed, it was commited to a seperate branch on GitHub to be reviewed by the team and checked for conflicts, before being added to our final project.

Finally, additional testing we carried out was to ensure... (e.g. no signs allowed input)

### UI Design

To decide upon the most appropriate design we will be using A/B testing. This is a method where two versions of the webpage are taken to compare against one another and then determine which one performs better and has a more appropriate design for our converter in this case. We will do this through the google form, we created above.

Below are the designs that have been collated and placed in the google form. The most popular will be the nearest to the final design; feedback will be taken to improve our webpage to be the most functional, beneficial and appropriate design.

### UI Design Results

From the google form, it is clear that the majority votes were with... 

## GitHub Pages 

We have chosen to use GitHub pages, as it is a service that takes HTML, CSS nad JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub and runs the files through a build process and then to publish a website. It is easy for collaboration and clearly identifies where improvements have been made and by who.

GitHub actions?

## Issues with GitHub

Whilst working on our Assignment we had issues with GitHub as shown below GitHub reported outages with the Actions and Pages, this caused us to have an increased number of commits:
