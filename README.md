## Welcome!

### Problem Statement 

We will be creating a colour code converter. The MVP is that it will allow you to convert RGB to Hex colours and vice versa.

## Roles

|Name     | Job Roles    |
|---------|--------------|
|Nicholas Hadjioannou| Scrum Master |
|Jonathan Daniel      | DevOps       |
|Husna Dar   | UX           |
|Georgia Bond | QA           |
|Ella Margetts    | QA           |


We worked well as a team, by regularly enduring google meets created by Nick, to ensure we knew what our current and next task was and to see if anyone needed help. This made sure we were all on track for the deadline and there was no confusion; every step was completed.


## Coding Practice
We will be coding using React. Initially, we had to take some time away to research and develop our understanding. We chose to use React as not only is it flexible but fast and simple to use as a framework for handling the view of our web. It also allows for easy collaboration.

### Continuous integration/continuous delivery

## Testing 

Code
<br>
We will be running smoke tests as our preliminary testing to confirm that our build is stable enough for further testing. Smoke tests will easily identify small failures, for us to fix. During our testing phase, we will also be 'throwing an error'; to indicate whether anything unexpected will happen to disrupt the normal flow of execution. 

Design
<br>
We will be sending out a google form to our cohort to ensure the best design is chosen; the one thats simpler to navigate, easier to use and the most appropriate font and colour. We will also run an accessibility and performance audit on our HTML, to ensure that is running smoothly.

### Our Testing Examples

## Testing Strategy 

Our first testing consisted of smoke testing, to determine whether the initial build is stable or not. We created a test to throw out an error when a user...

We decided to work on testing our individual functions before incooperating the HTML/CSS...

To ensure good coding practice throughout this project we regularly tested and went through our code reviews as a team on pull requests before they were merged into the main branch.

Our workflow meant that we worked well as a team; one worked on the issue relevant to their area and if they needed help, it was easy to collobrate and let the rest of the team know. Once the coding, designs or testing had been completed, it was commited to a seperate branch on GitHub to be reviewed by the team and checked for conflicts, before being added to our final project.

Finally, additional testing we carried out was to ensure... (e.g. no signs allowed input)

## UI Design

To create the following mock designs...


### Design 1:

### Design 2:

## Google Forms
### A/B Testing Form

To decide upon the most appropriate design we will be using A/B testing. This is a method where two versions of the webpage are taken to compare against one another and then determine which one performs better and has a more appropriate design for our converter. We will do this through the google form we created below and sent out to the rest of our cohort.

The most popular will be the nearest to the final design; feedback will be taken to improve our webpage to be the most functional, beneficial and appropriate design.

From the google form, it is clear that the majority votes were for Design 1. The main feedback was that the colours matched better which made it more appealing as well as the Dark colours made it eye catching. UI Designer Husna went ahead and did the Html and Css for this design based on the feedback from her mockups.


### End User Testing Form
End-user testing can help us find out more information on the ease of use. The benefit is feedback on layout, navigation, errors, etc, to see where improvement can be made. Therefore, to know what to do in the future we sent out another google form.

### Results

From these we gathered...

## GitHub Pages 

We have chosen to use GitHub pages, as it is a service that takes HTML, CSS nad JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub and runs the files through a build process and then to publish a website. It is easy for collaboration and clearly identifies where improvements have been made and by who.

We have also setup Github Actions to run our integration tests and make sure that they are passing.

## GitHub Issues

Whilst working on our Assignment we used GitHub Issues. We created issues on GitHub around tasks we need to complete or areas we need approval or help on. This was useful in....

For those who are unsure of how to input their colour codes, please observe the examples shown below for the RGB and Hex formats:
<br>

RGB: 65,104,220 

- Please ensure you include a comma between each value in order for the conversion to work. You must make sure that each value you enter is a number between 0 and 255. The lower the value is, the less saturated the colour will be and vice versa.

Hex: #8a2be2  

- The Hex code must have a hashtag at the beginning, otherwise the code will be invalid. Each hex code must contain 6 values. No more and no less.

As clear, the final webpage used the design 1, with a few tweaks after gaining our UI testing results. We decided to... Design 1 was overall, the most appropriate... In future, we would...
